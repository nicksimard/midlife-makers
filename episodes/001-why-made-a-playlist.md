Welcome to the Midlife Makers Podcast. This is the very first episode. I'm Nick and this is where I collect sparks. Little makes, experiments and reflections that remind me it's never too late to create. Today's episode is about the day I made a playlist instead of, well, instead of overthinking my next big move, which, if you know me,
is basically my Olympic sport. Before we jump in, today's episode is sponsored by Endless Strategy Sessions. You know them, the meetings in your own head where you draw six different frameworks on a whiteboard, color code your sticky notes, and then walk away with nothing actually made.
Endless Strategy Sessions, proudly offering you the illusion of progress since your early 20s. So, here's what happened. I had this restless energy. This sense that I should be starting something. And my brain instantly reached for it's favorite tool, a brand new strategy. You know that feeling where you're not sure what to make yet?
So you start designing the scaffolding for a skyscraper you might never even build. I was sketching names, drafting content calendars, imagining funnels, subscribers, how it could all scale one day. In other words, I was stuck in my head. And I caught myself. Because I've been down that road enough to know where it ends. Exhaustion without creation.
So I stopped. And instead of spinning up another brainstorm doc, I opened Spotify. And I made a playlist. Just an hour of music, sequenced like a little journey, spark, flame, afterglow. No monetization strategy, no business plan, not even a clever framework, just songs that made me feel alive. And you know what?
That playlist turned into one of the first artifacts in my makening, something small enough that I couldn't talk myself out of it, but real enough to hold energy. I still come back to it. Other people listen to it. It's an actual thing, not a thought cloud. It taught me something that I keep forgetting.
Sometimes the way forward isn't bigger strategy, it's smaller making. The smallest artifacts beat the grandest plans that you'll never finish. Now, here's the funny part. My instinct was to dismiss it, to say it's just a playlist, like it didn't count. But that's perfectionism sneaking back in, trying to convince me that only big important things matter.
The truth is, making something tiny, a playlist, a note, even this podcast episode, creates momentum. It gets you out of your head and into your life. And in mid-life, that feels especially urgent. Because time is moving. And the choice is, drift or make. That playlist was my proof that sparks matter more than strategies.
That a little act of creation is worth more than a polished plan that sits in a folder, forever. So that's today's spark. If you find yourself in overthinking quicksand, maybe stop strategizing and start sequencing songs. You'll be surprised with how alive that makes you feel. This has been the Midlife Makers Podcast, where creativity doesn't expire at 40,
and every small make counts. Thanks for listening, and I'll see you next time.
